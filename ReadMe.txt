Project Description:

One Person texted me in Telegram. He sent me the Github link to the Django Project and then, he asked me to make DRF with CRUD together in the project.

And after many troubles and wasting much time, I did it!

This ReadMe file and admin_panel_api app created by me. In other words, ReadMe file and admin_panel_api app were not in the original project, when he just sent me the link.

I also made video presentation of my completed task: https://youtu.be/paelZ47I4UQ
